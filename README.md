<h2> Greetings Fren! ðŸ‘‹

### I'm Weston Nelson, a smart contract developer and a Web3 builder. 

___

I believe that decentralization - combined with the power of programmable money - are the most important tools we possess as a civilization in order to make us the best version of ourselves.

I enjoy working on challenging problems, working with fun and driven colleagues, and continually refining my skills as a developer. 

I am currently working on a Yield Optimization project, that would create the first Omnichain Yield Optimizer, powered using interoperability tech at the forefront of the blockchain ecosystem.
